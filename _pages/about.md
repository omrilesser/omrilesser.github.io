I am a theoretical physicist studying quantum condensed matter.

I am a Bethe/KIC postdoctoral fellow at Cornell University, where I am working on various aspects of quantum many-body physics, ranging from disordered superconductors, through fractional states in Chern bands, and all the way to machine learning for quantum matter.

Prior to that, I got my PhD at the Weizmann Institute of Science. There, my main research interest was topological superconductivity and the pursuit of non-Abelian states in actual mesoscopic systems.

I am interested in theoretical condensed matter, broadly defined, and I greatly enjoy collaborating with experimental groups.
